# universal_notifier

This is a simple dart package that implements Stream based notifiers. This package originated out of personal necessity,
so while it should work just fine, there are not tests or example... for now at least!

For documentation please see [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/universal_notifier)!

The key-distinguishing-factor of this package however are the cascading collections. These also notify their listeners
when their children notify their listeners!
